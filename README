## V1
Pointer-based relay system.
Works on the basis of processing 'instructions'. Charge is passed through the network with the value of it decreasing based on time passing.
A spontaneous, impulse type system.
_Kinda dumb and a bit slow. Not the best idea._
**Not finished**

## V2
Pointer-based relay system.
Works on the basis of computing the result of an operation using the inputs of a node.
Systematic execution of nodes using a specified input snapshot.
_A good concept for structured execution. If I finished it and improved the generation engine, it could be viable!_
**Not finished, should go back to this**

## V3
_I seem to have lost this. Whoops :(_

## V4
Pointer-based relay system.
Works on the basis of charge being passed through the network.
Spontaneous impulse-driven system. If charge is insufficent to trigger node, it is stored.
_Frankly, similar to V1, but much better executed. Could be viable for spontaneousness._
**Not finished, under construction**

## V5
Pointer-based relay system.
Works on the basis of performing a sequence of instructional operations on node inputs.
Systematic execution of nodes from input snapshot.
_Again, similar in concept to V2, but better written. More viable than V2, on a computational side._
**Nearly finished**

## V6 **FUTURE**
Grid-based modular system.
Works on the basis of binary comparisons of values from adjacent cells, with a set of different input pattern and comparison mode.
Systematic outward execution of nodes from input snapshot, which always waits for all values to arrive in a node (i.e. inputs are either true or false, not undecided).
Input strength system, allowing nodes to change type if an input feed is not active.
_Hopefully, a sort of ultimate hybrid between the different ideas in V1-5. Functional test might be exploring a test file system. Can't wait!_
**Next up!**
